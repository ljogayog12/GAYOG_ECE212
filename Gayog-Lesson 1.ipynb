The plain, easy-to-learn syntax of Python enhances readability and thus decreases software maintenance costs. Python manages modules and packages that promote software precision and reuse of code.

So, in this lesson, this course pack will teach us how to understand and make a program in Python. Understanding computer programs requires an algorithmic, unthinking justification. In this way, knowledge of computer codes entails a lot of mental recreation of what is actually going to happen, not what you expect to happen. In addition, this includes creative analytical thought, which means the capacity to prepare, to consider arrangements and to articulate them unequivocally and specifically.         "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Activity\n\n1.) Why do you think understanding computer programs is relevant in our time today especially in the new normal?\n\nAs Steve Jobs once said, \"Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.\" Computer programming is a massively adaptable technique that you can use to do stunning tasks that are usually either manual and laborious or literally outlandish. Computer programming makes life easy for us, by coding it produces systematic and creative thinking, and by learning programs it helps us to be persistent. Especially in this new normal stage of life, programming is kind of important to all of us. Since we are confined to doing something outside our premises, we prefer to abuse this by using our digital devices.\n\n2.) If you were able to learn computer program, what program will you code? Why?\n\nIf I could know a computer program, I suppose I'm going to stick to studying python. As it has been said, Python language is not only a high-level programming language, but is also flexible and is currently being taught.\n\n3.) What would be your pirmary motivation in learning programming?\n\nThe main reason will be that this would allow us a lot to consider our profession in the future. Apart from that, this current standard condition may also serve to facilitate the management of operations on computers.                                                                                                                                                                    "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Application: Ask Yourself\n\n1.) Why do you think Python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing?\n\nWhat really is Python? Writing Python code is easy, and the rate of development apart from reading Python code is similarly normal. Over all, Python still offers us tried and tested adaptability. This makes Python's claim one of the most looked for in the wake of accreditation programming. Programming languages have been around for quite a time, and they reliably watch the dispatch of other languages intensely motivating designers. Python is quickly growing to the front line of the most mainstream programming languages in the world, and its remarkable creation has unmistakably emerged on Stock Overflow as opposed to other programming languages.\n\n2.) If Python can build anything, where do you think Python is not applicable for?\n\nDespite the fact that Python can construct something, there are a few drawbacks as well. Python has a modest speed of execution, which means that it operates as an interpreter, not a compiler. Python runs slower than C, C++, Java and several different languages. Second, it has an immense amount of memory usage, and so it is not fair to use it for improvement under restricted memory constraint.Third, the change in Smartphone and Gaming is not acceptable due to the use of more memory and its modest speed of handling relative to other programming dialects. Finally, it's hard to test, because it's an interpreter-based language, it's hard to run experiments on code written in Python."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exercises "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Exercise 1: Mailing Address (Solved, 9 Lines)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Create a program that displays your name and complete mailing addresss.
